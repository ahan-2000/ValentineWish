  "wishText": "My love, on this special day of love, I want to sail with you into the depths of our love story, just like Jack and Rose in Titanic (Please give me some space in the wood !!). Let's explore the layers of our love, as deep and intricate as the dreams within dreams in Inception. You have been a constant like Martha was to Jonas across all the dimensions of the world, across all the time of the universe. They faded away saying a line which eventually became our line - We're perfect for each other, never believe in anything else. As we dance to the beat of our love, let's sing the song of our hearts, just like the beautiful melody of Perfect. You have my heart and soul, today and always. Happy Valentine's Day, my love.",
